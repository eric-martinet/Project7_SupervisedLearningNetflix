# Supervised learning in Python
*Rana Youssef, Helmi Chaaba & Eric Martinet*

**Data Analytics bootcamp @IronHack Paris, Feb-Apr 22**

## Project description

The goal of this project is to practice supervised learning using Netflix/IMDB data.

## Expectations
- Clean, well-commented code
- Clean data with EDA
- Clear board in Trello with logged time for each task
- Clear description of each model
- Models implementation and comparison

## Repo organisation
- [data](./data): original and cleaned data
- [notebook](./notebook): Jupyter notebooks to clean & explore data, and one notebook for each SL model


## Results
In our case and selection of models, the best model is the decision tree classifier, the second best the voting classifier.

We reject the Gaussian NB and the Quadractics Discrimimant Analysis.
