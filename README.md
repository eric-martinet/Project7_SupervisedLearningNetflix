# Supervised learning in Python
*Rana Youssef, Helmi Chaaba & Eric Martinet*

**Data Analytics bootcamp @IronHack Paris, Feb-Apr 22**

## Project description

The goal of this project is to practice supervised learning using Netflix/IMDB data.

## Expectations
- Clean, well-commented code
- Clean data with EDA
- Clear board in Trello with logged time for each task
- Clear description of each model
- Models implementation and comparison

## Repo organisation
- [data](./data): original and cleaned data
- [notebook](./notebook): Jupyter notebooks to clean & explore data, and one notebook for each SL model


## Results
In our case (data cleaning & encoding, selection of models, features selection and hyperparameters tuning), the best model is the decision tree classifier, while Gaussian NB and Voting Classifier can do a good enough job.

However, we reject the Quadractics Discrimimant Analysis.
